**深夜写完代码喝了一杯咖啡，久久不能入睡，尽管事实真相并不清晰，但是想到最近的国事，天下兴亡匹夫有责，少年强则国强。在回想当今国难当头发国难财的人比比皆是，我们为了生存选择沉默，但是对于这样敢于发声的英雄，相信历史会给予评判盖棺定论。**

**死者为大，祝安息！**

**Beijing (CNN)—** The death of a doctor [widely regarded as a hero](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/03/asia/coronavirus-doctor-whistle-blower-intl-hnk/index.html) in China for blowing the whistle on the threat posed by the Wuhan coronavirus has led to a massive outpouring of grief and anger online.

Li Wenliang died of the virus in the early hours of Friday morning local time, Wuhan Central Hospital, where he worked, said in a statement. The confirmation follows a series of conflicting statements about his condition from the hospital and Chinese state media outlets.
"Our hospital's ophthalmologist Li Wenliang was unfortunately infected with coronavirus during his work in the fight against the coronavirus epidemic," the hospital said. "He died at 2:58 am on Feb 7 after attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful."
Li was among a number of supposed "rumormongers" detained in December for spreading news about the virus. He had warned about a potential "SARS-like" virus spreading in Wuhan. Nothing Li said was incorrect, but it came as officials in the city were downplaying the severity of the outbreak and its risk to the public.
There were more apparent efforts to control the narrative even after Li's death -- leading to widespread anger.
Earlier on Thursday night, several state media outlets had reported Li's death, following which Chinese social media erupted in mourning. Hours of confusion followed, with Wuhan Central Hospital releasing a statement saying Li was still alive and in critical condition, adding that they were "making attempts to resuscitate him."
State media subsequently deleted their previous tweets, only for the hospital to then confirm his death.








## Wuhan's whistleblower

Li had raised the alarm about the virus that ultimately took his life.
In December, he posted in his medical school alumni group on the Chinese messaging app WeChat that seven patients from a local seafood market had been diagnosed with a SARS-like illness and were quarantined in his hospital in Wuhan.
Soon after he posted the message, Li was accused of rumor-mongering by the Wuhan police.
He was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak, which has sickened more than 28,000 people and killed more than 560. He later contracted the virus himself.
Li was hospitalized on January 12 and tested positive for the coronavirus on February 1.

## Fury on social media

China's social media channels were awash with anger following news of Li's death.
The topics "Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology," and "We want freedom of speech," soon began to trend on China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo. Each gained tens of thousands of views before disappearing from the heavily censored platform.
Another topic, called "I want freedom of speech," had drawn 1.8 million views as of 5 a.m. Friday morning local time (4 p.m. ET Thursday).
Top comments under the Wuhan Central Hospital's statement about Li's death included "I've learned two words: political rescue & performative rescue" and "Countless young people will mature overnight after today: the world is not as beautiful as we imagined. Are you angry? If any of us here is fortunate enough to speak up for the public in the future, please make sure you remember tonight's anger."
Several comments also marked the timing of the announcement. "I knew you would post this in the middle of the night," wrote one Weibo user.
"You think we've all gone to sleep? No. We haven't," said another.

## Confusion over his condition

The Global Times first announced Li had died in a tweet at around 10:40 p.m. local time Thursday, linking to a report that cited friends and doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital.
It deleted the post several hours later. Other Chinese media outlets also deleted their reports of his death, without explanation. The World Health Organization released a message of condolence following the initial reports that Li was dead but later updated their statement to say they did not have any information about the doctor's status.
Wuhan Central Hospital issued a new statement confirming his death later that day.
The death toll and number of people infected by the Wuhan coronavirus continues to grow, with no signs of slowing despite severe quarantine and population control methods put in place in central China.
The number of confirmed cases globally stood at 28,275 as of Thursday, with more than 28,000 of those in China. The number of cases in China grew by 3,694, or 15%, on the previous day. There have been 565 deaths so far, all but two of which were in China, with one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong.

- Every time we witness an injustice and do not act, we train our character to be passive in its presence and thereby eventually lose all ability to defend ourselves and those we love.

- 每一次我们目睹不公正而不采取行动，我们压抑个性，表面上顺从，因此最终失去了所有保护自己和我们所爱之人的能力。
 
- If we have brains or courage, then we are blessed and called on not to frit these qualities away, standing agape at the ideas of others, winning pissing contests, improving the efficiencies of the neocorporate state, or immersing ourselves in obscuranta, but rather to prove the vigor of our talents against the strongest opponents of love we can find.

- 如果我们有智慧或勇气，就会被赞为得天独厚并且被期望保留这些品质，忍住对别人的想法的惊异，赢得撒尿比赛，提高社会地位和影响力，或者沉浸在自己的愚昧中，而不是去证明我们天赋的活力，抵抗爱最强大的敌人。

- If we can only live once, then let it be a daring adventure that draws on all our powers. Let it be with similar types whos hearts and heads we may be proud of. Let our grandchildren delight to find the start of our stories in their ears but the endings all around in their wandering eyes.
 
- 如果我们只能活这一次，那就让它成为一场牵动我们全部力量的英勇历险吧。让它类于那些让我们骄傲的伟大思想和心灵。让我们的子孙能够欣喜地发现，他们听到我们故事的开头，而结尾已经在他们环视周遭的目光中实现了。

- The whole universe or the structure that perceives it is a worthy opponent, but try as I may I can not escape the sound of suffering. Perhaps as an old man I will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance. But not now; men in their prime, if they have convictions are tasked to act on them. 

- 人们认为整个宇宙，或者万物的构成都是阴阳相依，但我却无法摆脱痛苦呻吟声的折磨。或许当我老了，我会在实验室里闲散度日，或是在夏夜里与学生们轻声交谈，捱过无忧无虑的日子。但不是现在；不是作为重负在身的盛年之人。

- Our No. 1 enemy is ignorance. And I believe that is the No. 1 enemy for everyone — it's not understanding what actually is going on in the world.
我们的头号敌人是无知。 我相信这是每个人的头号敌人 - 这是因为我们不了解世界上究竟发生了什么。
